### Remove the frustrating +1 level limit from Quark's Ancient Tomes!
#### 🔧 The Problem

Quark's Ancient Tomes are a fantastic way to push your enchantments beyond their natural limits, but they come with an arbitrary restriction: you can only upgrade an enchantment by one single level above its maximum.

Got Sharpness V and want to reach Sharpness VII? Too bad — the tome will stop working after Sharpness VI, even if you have multiple tomes. This limitation makes collecting Ancient Tomes feel unrewarding in the long run.

#### ✅ The Solution

This mod removes that restriction completely. Now, each Ancient Tome you apply increases the enchantment by one level, allowing for true progression.

Want Sharpness X? Collect enough tomes and you can get there! This creates a satisfying long-term goal and makes every Ancient Tome you find feel valuable.

#### ⚙️ Fully Configurable

Every server and player is different. That's why this patch includes a simple configuration file:
- Set your own limit: Want just +3 above max? Or +10? You decide.
- Disable entirely: Set the value to 0 to restore original Quark behavior.
- Easy configuration: Just edit config/quark-ancient-tomes-patch.toml

Default: Up to +3 levels above maximum (e.g., Sharpness V → VIII).
#### 🎯 Perfect For
- Modpack makers looking for balanced enchanting alternatives to Apotheosis enchanting module
- Players who want their hard-earned Ancient Tomes to remain useful
- Servers that want customizable progression systems
